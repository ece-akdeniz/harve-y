## 2026-10-10 13:37 — Hosted sandbox baseline and RFQ probe (MEASURED HOSTED)

- Revision: `e543b5d5d14fff699019bdffb38688c3bee882b7`, kit `1b5516b`; added diagnostic
  scripts `tools/sandbox_baseline.py` and `tools/rfq_timing_probe.py`. PackageAgent default
  anchor 12%, five-step schedule, close gap 0.5%; deterministic templates, no model calls.
- Hypothesis: optimizing complete packages improves the starter; independent RFQ requests
  can reduce idle-thread timeouts. These are separate experiments, not a controlled ablation.
- Data: downloaded `data/package/world.sqlite`, SHA256
  `4d8c896740350218d39f9d1ceada7b937f0d4e3078a155312851b8c09ed172b9`.
  Verified 447 suppliers, 60 parts, 166 cost-driver rows, 2,258 index values, 208 documents.
  Sunday release not yet available. Do not confuse the full supplier table with the active
  suppliers in challenge cases.
- Naive, one run per case: D01 **20.04/100**, C=€440,757.33, 35.85s, zero timeouts;
  D02 **22.95/100**, C=€201,088.00, 75.28s, one timeout on DEMO-J1. Both deals satisfy must-haves.
  Sessions `7ba285e7808110f7`, `92060a989d6ae9e0`.
- PackageAgent clean rerun, one run per case: D01 **93.24/100**, C=€411,339.92, 8.95s;
  D02 **41.89/100**, C=€190,184.00, 25.30s. Both deals satisfy must-haves; zero timeouts.
  Sessions `923ce268740f20fc`, `fcaea618ad0cdf72`. Unweighted two-case mean **67.57/100**
  versus naive **21.49/100**. This small, unrepeated sample is not a generalization estimate.
- One-round concurrent D02 timing probe: both requests started within 1ms; replies at 14.91s
  and 70.30s; zero timeouts in post-reply snapshots. The probe closed at **27.20/100**.
  Session `52a8e87b7ab4899d`. This was a timing test, not the PackageAgent strategy.
  Server serialization/clock-stop mechanism and sustained multi-round safety remain unknown.
  Production must process replies as they arrive: waiting for both left the first thread idle
  for about 55.4s, close to its 60s limit.
- Invalid strategy comparison retained: sessions `a18869e79c54c4fb`, `a794e41d3e700a8c`
  ended at zero/no deal with three timeouts on every thread. macOS power logs confirm clamshell
  sleep at 13:25:32, waking at 13:32:15 (403s). Exclude these from strategy comparison, retain
  as operational failures. Do not attribute the delay solely to the hosted service. Monotonic
  elapsed time understated wall time across sleep. The clean rerun used `caffeinate -i`.
- Quota: all baseline/probe runs used sandbox only (seven sessions total including
  interrupted cases); practice remains **0 used / 200 available**. No provider-model spend.
- Decision: keep PackageAgent v0 as the measured development baseline; do not deploy it to the
  final unchanged. Prioritize RFQ scheduling, coordinated guarded close/reconciliation,
  relationship-cost estimates and evaluation across diverse cases before added model complexity.
  Keep laptop lid open; rehearse the actual final host/network and deadline recovery.
- Validation: 14 tests pass; Ruff passes. These checks do not verify final readiness.

## 2026-10-10 12:40 - E0/v0 on local arena-sim (MEASURED LOCAL, not hosted)

- Setup: arena-sim (kit 1b5516b), data package identical to audited copy (dump hash match).
- E0 naive: S01 0.521, S02 0.513, S03 0.678 -> mean 57.1. Naive works one RFQ thread only and leaves
  non-price terms at plan values.
- v0 PackageAgent (complete-cost best non-price terms, 12 % anchor, 5-round linear schedule,
  re-offer our terms at their price before accepting, one checked close): S01 0.829, S02 0.861,
  S03 0.886 -> mean 85.8. All deals beat alternative; must-haves ok.
- Caveat: the sim supplier is a fixed script that prices nothing but unit_price. Hosted suppliers
  price payment/incoterm/contract terms; the non-price gain will be smaller there. Do not tune
  anchor/schedule on the sim.
- Next: hosted D01/D02 with v0 once the key exists; record timeouts/rounds per RFQ thread.

## 2026-10-10 13:35 - E0/v0 on hosted sandbox D01/D02 (MEASURED HOSTED)

- First attempt: 4 sessions timed out at 0 - launch error (processes killed after opening), not agent.
- naive: D01 0.200, D02 0.229. v0: D01 0.932 (deal 50.50, FCA, 60 d), D02 0.419 (J1 final_offer
  15.70, payment 30 d, accepted). Replays: naive D01 /replay/e496ba4e489d30ff, D02 /replay/265fc0a0a379b326.
- Next: read v0 D02 replay - why J1 went to final_offer early and whether C1 was the better path.

## 2026-10-10 13:41 - v0 on hosted practice P01 (MEASURED HOSTED, 1 session)

- v0: 0.567 (accepted final_offer 143.40 from 2027-04-01, 90 d). House agent 0.97.
- Replay findings: (1) suppliers send several alternative sheets per mail - v0 read only the
  first and missed EUR 136.80 from 2026-11-01; (2) v0 flipped effective_date mid-negotiation and
  the supplier priced it (+6.50); (3) supplier itself cites LCI-C +2.7 % x 30 % and PPI-C241
  +6.5 % x 24 % -> ~2.4 % justified vs 9.5 % asked: claims are the lever; (4) supplier prices
  payment terms (136.20 @30 d vs 138.40 @90 d).
- Fix v0.1: evaluate every sheet in the latest message by C; lock non-price terms after the
  first offer. Sim regression 85.8 unchanged. Next: index claims for price_increase cases.

## 2026-10-10 14:30 - Evidence: claim bank + supplier cost estimates (BUILD, local only, 0 sessions)

- `claims.build_bank(case, package)`: latest-12-month index windows per cost driver (+ indices the
  case cites), cherry-picked buyer windows (flagged, off by default), rival quotes (per receiving
  supplier, `reveals_rival`), scorecard OTD/ppm, letter notice vs. contract notice, should-cost
  (`internal`). Every claim passes `verify` against package + release + case facts.
- `pick` default: <= 3 claims, buyer-side only, no private disclosure, no ID reuse (`claim_keys`).
  P01 default pick: notice (doc:20260911-70110-P01 51 d vs ctr:4600070110), PPI-D351 -3.7 %,
  scorecard OTD 85.2 %. LCI-C +2.7 % and PPI-C241 +6.5 % stay internal (adverse).
- `cost_pressure_estimate`: P01 stated drivers -> 2.37 pp on 54 % coverage (listed drivers: 2.33 pp
  on 64 %); sentence has no IDs, `verified: False`.
- `dossiers.supplier_estimate`: P01 full cost 132.64 (+-5 %) vs current 126.53 -> margin -4.8 %
  at status quo; rate 0.15 (wants_fast_payment). Relationship term is live even at today's price.
- Sunday: `claims.prep(data_dir, out_path, release)` rebuilds dossiers + banks with the overlay.
- Not integrated into agent.py; claims experiment (vs. mechanical baseline) still to run.

## 2026-10-10 14:05 - Runtime: async runner vs serial on D02 sandbox (MEASURED HOSTED SANDBOX)

- Hypothesis: one worker per thread + coordinator (`negotiator.runner`, `--runner async`) keeps
  RFQ threads free of timeouts with the same score as the serial loop.
- Config: commit c95a73b + uncommitted runtime (runner/client/state), PackageAgent-v0.2, closes via
  `evaluator.close_decision`; limiter 8 calls/s; 60 s move limit, close wait 20 s, cap margin
  max(90 s, slowest + 15 s). Quota: 0 practice (sandbox only).
- Run A (no send slot, 3 parallel sessions): async 0.419 ×3, thread timeouts 0/0 ×3; wall 59 s.
  Concurrent POSTs on one hosted session each took ~16-18 s (vs ~0.5 s alone), and one close hit
  `422 not a standing offer` (closer read the old offer while the chosen thread's reply was being
  stored) - reconciled and re-decided, deal kept. Fixed: in-flight flag cleared only after the
  reply is in the thread.
- Run B (soft per-session send slot, falls back to concurrent sends 25 s before a thread's
  deadline): async 0.419 ×3 + CLI `negotiator play case:D02 --runner async` 0.419, timeouts 0/0
  ×4, wall 25 s for 3 parallel sessions, no close errors.
- Serial control (`negotiator.play.play_case`, 3 parallel sessions): 0.419 ×3, timeouts 0/0 ×3,
  wall 6 s.
- Reading: D02 hosted replies are mostly fast, so serial does not time out on D02 either; the
  async benefit is only shown where a supplier reply takes 30-70 s (earlier hosted probe: C1 70 s;
  local tests with injected 30/50 s delays: async 0 timeouts, serial waiting costs a 409 late).
  Hosted seems to serialise/penalise concurrent calls on one session -> keep the send slot.
- Raw: `runs/20261010-140107-D02-runner-compare/`, `runs/20261010-140327-D02-runner-compare/`,
  `runs/20261010-140410/`.
- Decision: keep serial default; async passes D02 gate (0 timeouts, same score) and runtime tests.
  Promote after an RFQ with slow replies (practice, budgeted) shows no regression.

## 2026-10-10 14:10 - Runtime: async runner with agent.propose (hold) vs serial, D02 (MEASURED HOSTED SANDBOX)

- Config: 89a4389 + runner hold support (`agent.propose` -> send / close / hold), PackageAgent-v0.2
  with propose, closes via `evaluator.close_decision`; per-session send slot on. Quota: 0 practice.
- Batch 1 (3 parallel async sessions, then 3 parallel serial; hosted replies slow, 13-24 s):
  async 0.116 / 0.461 / 0.116, serial 0.461 ×3. Thread timeouts 0/0 in all 6.
  The two 0.116 runs: identical buyer moves to the serial runs; J1 answered our counter to its
  final offer (same price, our terms) with `walked_away`, so the coordinator accepted C1's final
  17.20. In the third async run J1 kept its final and we got 15.50 (0.461). All three async runs
  sent that counter ~15 s after J1's final (send slot waiting on C1's slow reply); walk vs keep
  differed with the same gap, so this looks like supplier randomness on countering a final offer,
  not a clock effect. Not proven.
- Batch 2 (3 parallel async, hosted fast, 8 s wall): 0.461 ×3, timeouts 0/0 ×3.
- Totals for async on D02 today: 10 runs, 0 thread timeouts; serial 6 runs, 0 timeouts.
- Raw: `runs/20261010-140547-D02-runner-compare/`, `runs/20261010-140838-D02-runner-compare/`.
- Decision: runtime gate "no timeouts on repeated D02" met for async. Keep serial default until
  Decision reviews the counter-to-final walk risk (2/9 async v0.2 runs) and an RFQ with slow
  replies is compared.
